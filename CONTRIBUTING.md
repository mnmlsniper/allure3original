## Development

To start the development locally install the dependencies and build the project packages:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

You can use `@allurereport/sandbox` as a playground for the development. Consult [README.md in the package](./packages/sandbox/README.md) for detailed instructions.
